If you’ve been feeling baffled as to what is actually so smart about Smart, we’ve designed this handy guide to walk you through the techy stuff, jargon and all the benefits of these jazzy new gadgets!\n\nSo what actually are they \U0001F926‍♀️?\n\nSmart Meters replace your standard gas and electricity meter and were introduced as part of a government initiative to upgrade the UK energy system. Every home must be offered a Smart Meter by 2024 which are compatible with both credit and prepayment meters. They work just like your regular meters, but they automatically and electronically send your meter readings directly to your energy company via a secure communications network called the DCC (Data Communications Company). Nifty stuff! Smart Meters also come with an In-Home Display (IHD), which many people often confuse with being the meter itself (it isn’t!). The IHD is a small separate screen that can be plugged in anywhere in your home that shows you your real-time usage in pounds and pence.\n\nWhat the heck is this SMETS business\U0001F92F?\n\nSMETS stands for Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specification and refers to the generation of Smart Meter; there are two, SMETS 1 and SMETS 2. The difference? SMETS 2 meters are enrolled with the DCC, so they keep communicating your readings even when you change supplier. Currently, the SMETS 1 meters will lose their functionality temporarily when you change supplier, until they have an upgrade installed. Because of this difference, Socket only take on DCC-enrolled customers (SMETS 2 and SMETS 1 upgraded meters) so make sure you get yourself onto the right meter ASAP\U0001F609!\n\nOkay so SMETS 2 all the way, but what can they actually do for me that makes them so good?\n\nWell, for one, Smart Meters help you to not just understand, but also track, monitor and reduce your energy usage, helping you to save money. By providing you with a daily, weekly and monthly view of your energy usage you can figure out what habits might be costing you the most (KIDS, turn the TV OFF standby!!!). You can also wave goodbye to the days of scrabbling around on your hands and knees in the cupboard under the stairs to provide your energy company with a meter reading; those babies are sent off automatically! You can just sit back, relax and let your Smart Meter do the hard work for you. \n\nSo much in our homes is now smart, our watches, TVs, even our fridges, so why shouldn’t our energy be smart also? Here at Socket, we know how smart you are \U0001F913, it’s time our energy was too! Don’t waste another moment and get your Smart Meter installation booked today – it’s so easy to arrange, just speak to your current supplier. Once your meter is up-to-date you’ll be ready to jump onto the Socket Rocket! Simply head over to our website/look out for us on your favourite comparison websites, we’ll be waiting for you!\n\nReady to plug in? It’s how energy should work \U0001F4A1."
