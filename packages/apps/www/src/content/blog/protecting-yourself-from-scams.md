    Scammers are getting more and more savvy, using technology to make them
    harder to spot. For instance, they may phone a potential victim with a
    “spoof” phone number, making it appear to be a legitimate number when it is
    in fact from a trickster.


    That is why it is important that everyone takes steps to ensure that they
    and their loved ones know what to look out for.


    **Common Scams to look out for**


    * A caller may claim your computer is having some sort of problem – such as
    being infected with malware or a virus – and only they can help you fix it.
    They then remote into your computer, and steal sensitive details.

    * Claiming you are owed money, and they need your bank details to “return”
    it.

    * Claiming you owe money, and you must pay now, or there will be serious
    consequences.

    * Claiming they are a loved one in distress, and they need money as soon as
    possible.

    * Scams that say your account has been compromised – and they need your
    login details to “verify”. They then use these details to steal from the
    victim.


    **Here is what you can do to protect yourself against scams online or over
    the phone**


    * Never give sensitive details (such as bank information) to a cold-caller
    or any unverified party. If you are interested in engaging with a legitimate
    company, you can always phone them back on their publically posted phone
    number, or visit their legitimate website.

    * Check the URL/web address before you click on a link. If you hover over a
    link (but do not click), a web address should appear either in a pop up, or
    at the bottom of your browser page.

    * Make sure the URL/web address is legitimate. What matters is what is at
    the end of the address – that it the domain you are going to. For example
    www.news.google.com is a website owned by Google. But news.com is a
    completely different website (which redirects to
    https://www.cnet.com/news/). 

    * Browser pop ups that say you have “Won a prize”, “Have a computer virus”,
    or are “owed money/owe money”, should be treated with suspicion.

    * Remember, if you are uncomfortable, it is OK to say “no thank you” and
    hang up, delete the email, and/or close the browser popup.


    **Watch out for high pressure sales tactics, which include:**


    * **Not allowing you to take your time to decide if you wish to buy or
    not**. If a salesperson says a deal expires in a very short period of time
    (less than a day), consider walking away. If you really want the deal, few
    companies will turn away customer who is willing to buy from them.

    * **Skewed data**. If they say product is marked down at an extreme
    discount, it may not be true. There have been reports of some companies
    claiming non-existent markdowns. For instance, they will claim an item is
    marked down to £100 from £1000 – but the item was never actually offered at
    £1000. Another form of skewed data may be inflated reviews or testimonials.

    * **Trying to manipulate your emotions**. Saying that you have to buy
    because otherwise you will let others down, or you will deeply regret it,
    etc.

    Scam calls and emails have picked up in popularity in recent years, with
    many of them targeting vulnerable people and the elderly. There have been
    horror stories of people losing their entire pension, wiping out their
    savings, and ending up destitute.
