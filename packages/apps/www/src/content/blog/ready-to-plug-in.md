    ### We’re here to say hello…

    Introducing Socket, a brand-new energy company here to shake things up. We’re smart, straight-talking and we’re making it simple! Far more than just another energy company, we’re not simply a corporation, but a community, made up of members, not customers 👫.


    You are the future and we want to be the future of energy, so we’re working together, combining all the best minds to build a company that does far more than making sure you can turn the lights on. If you like the sound of this, there’s a lot more where that came from 😲!


    ### Super smart

    So, hello 👋! We’re Socket, the UK’s first smart-only energy company. This means we’ll only be taking on customers who have the latest Smart Meter, and help you make the most of it. With Socket, you’ll be able to see what you’re using in almost real-time and keep yourself on track for some great savings💸!


    ### Super simple

    We don’t do complicated here at Socket ❌. We speak to you in a language you understand – and this goes for our payments too. That’s right, you don’t need next-gen cryptology skills to decipher our bills🧐! We only have one tariff and with us you pay for your energy before you use it, just as you do with everything else. Makes sense, right?


    ### Super easy

    It’s no secret, everyone hates contacting their energy company, even us. So, we decided it’s time the days of scheduling a 2 hour hold wait into your daily planner should end⏰.


    Ain’t nobody got time for that!


    You can get in touch with us on your own terms and on your own time. Hallelujah🙌! On our website you can get answers to your questions from our FAQs or from one of our friendly community members. You can also speak to one of our advisors directly through live chat, we’re here for you!


    ### Super caring

    Unlike other energy companies, we’re not a faceless corporation. We’re all about you and we actually care🤗! We’ve built our lovely community to make your life easier, and to make energy more fun. Have your say on what works and what doesn’t, help each other by posting and answering questions and even share your ideas on what we could do next. Dreams can come true🤩!

    ### So, what are you waiting for?

    We might not quite be ready to start supplying your energy yet, but it’s the perfect time to start getting involved with Socket, we can’t wait to meet you🤝! Head on over to our social pages and give us your ideas, share your thoughts and test out our shiny new website. We’ll keep you updated with all things Socket and let you know when we’re all set to start supplying you, so you can be one of our first ever customers! It’s nice to feel important right 🙋?


    If you like the sound of what we think will be the greatest energy company in the world but don’t have a Smart Meter yet, DON’T PANIC😱! You’ve got plenty of time to get one installed.


    Make sure you keep following our blog to stay up to date on all the insider Socket deets; we’ve got some exciting stuff lined up you won’t want to miss out on😎.  The rocket is about to set off🚀, make sure you’re ready to join Socket🎉!
