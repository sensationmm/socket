    However, looking after a household’s energy is not something that is easy
    for everybody. There are many vulnerable people in the UK who struggle to
    set up and maintain this essential service.  Millions of Britons are in fuel
    poverty alone.


    Being a vulnerable customer could mean a variety of things – from illness
    and disability, to being of advanced age, or perhaps experiencing financial
    difficulty. There are also cases where customers are vulnerable in more ways
    than one.


    But what is the energy industry doing to support people who are vulnerable?


    It depends.


    Some suppliers have more services than others to support the vulnerable,
    while some suppliers offer less support.


    Our research has found that there are suppliers in the UK who offer the
    following services, which may be of use to those who require it:


    * Braille Bills

    * Audio Bills

    * Large print bills

    * Customer service agents who can communicate via video in British Sign
    Language

    * Assisted meter readings

    * Financial programmes

    * The Warm Home Discount

    * The ability to nominate someone you trust to handle your bills

    * Magnifying strips to aid with reading bills

    * And More


    Your supplier may also be able to put you on the Priority Services Register
    (PSR) – which may offer additional support. You can speak to your supplier
    about being added to the PSR.


    All of the above services may be useful, but there have been recent calls
    for the industry to do even more.


    Energy UK commissioned a recent [vulnerability
    report](https://www.energy-uk.org.uk/our-work/commission-for-customers-in-vulnerable-circumstances.html)
    that made several suggestions that may be put into practice in the future.
    These include:


    * A voluntary “Vulnerability Code of Conduct”.

    * Making sure that staff is well trained to identify and support vulnerable
    customers.

    * Better use of data to identify and support the vulnerable, and to guide
    them toward the required support.


    Support for vulnerable customers has grown, however it is important that
    those customers have what they need to be able to use energy in the ways
    they need to. If you don’t feel your supplier is properly supporting your
    situation, you may wish to move to a supplier who may suit you better. There
    are several suppliers who have taken steps to make their services
    accessible, and to support a variety of customers – and hopefully, services
    and support for the vulnerable will only continue to improve.
